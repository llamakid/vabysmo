<p class="First">The intravitreal injection procedure must be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent), and the availability of sterile paracentesis equipment (if required). Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide should be administered prior to the injection. Inject slowly until the rubber stopper reaches the end of the syringe to deliver the volume of 0.05 mL. Confirm delivery of the full dose by checking that the rubber stopper has reached the end of the syringe barrel.</p>
<p>Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.</p>
<p>Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., vision loss, eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay <span class="Italics">[see <a href="#section-S17">Patient Counseling Information (17)</a>]</span>. Each syringe should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new syringe should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before VABYSMO is administered to the other eye.</p>

<h2>6.2 Immunogenicity</h2>
<p class="First">The immunogenicity of VABYSMO was evaluated in plasma samples. The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to VABYSMO in immunoassays. The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to VABYSMO with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p>
<p>There is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with VABYSMO. In the nAMD and DME studies, the pre-treatment incidence of anti-faricimab antibodies was approximately 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. After initiation of dosing, anti-faricimab antibodies were detected in approximately 10.4% and 8.4% of patients with nAMD and DME respectively, treated with VABYSMO across studies and across treatment groups. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with VABYSMO.</p>

<h1>11 DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Faricimab-svoa is a humanized bispecific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that binds both vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). The fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of faricimab was engineered by selected point mutations to abolish binding interactions with Fcγ and FcRn receptors. Faricimab-svoa has a total molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture.</p>
<p>VABYSMO (faricimab-svoa) injection is a sterile, clear to opalescent, colorless to brownish-yellow solution in a single-dose glass vial for intravitreal administration. Each single-dose vial is designed to deliver 0.05 mL (50 microliters) of solution containing 6 mg faricimab-svoa, L-histidine (155 mcg), L-methionine (52.2 mcg), polysorbate 20 (20 mcg), sodium chloride (73.1 mcg), D-sucrose (2.74 mg) and Water for Injection, adjusted to pH 5.5 with acetic acid. The product does not contain an anti-microbial preservative.</p>

<a name="section-S12.1" id="section-S12.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>12.1	Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Faricimab is a humanized bispecific antibody that acts through inhibition of two pathways by binding to VEGF-A and Ang-2. By inhibiting VEGF-A, faricimab suppresses endothelial cell proliferation, neovascularization and vascular permeability. By inhibiting Ang-2, faricimab is thought to promote vascular stability and desensitize blood vessels to the effects of VEGF-A. Ang-2 levels are increased in some patients with nAMD and DME. The contribution of Ang-2 inhibition to the treatment effect and clinical response for nAMD and DME has yet to be established.</p>

<a name="section-S12.2" id="section-S12.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">Increased retinal thickness, assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), is associated with nAMD and DME. Leakage of blood and fluid from choroidal neovascularization, assessed by fluorescein angiography, is associated with nAMD. Reductions in central subfield thickness (CST) were observed from baseline through the first year of treatment across all treatment arms in the four Phase 3 studies in nAMD and DME.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption/Distribution</span></p>
<p>Maximum faricimab plasma concentrations (Cmax) are estimated to occur approximately 2 days post-dose. Mean (±SD) free faricimab (unbound to VEGF-A and Ang-2) plasma Cmax are estimated to be 0.23 (0.07) mcg/mL and 0.22 (0.07) mcg/mL in nAMD and in DME patients, respectively. After repeated intravitreal administrations, mean plasma free faricimab trough concentrations are predicted to be 0.002-0.003 mcg/mL for Q8W dosing. Although not directly measured in the vitreous, no accumulation of faricimab is expected in the vitreous and no accumulation has been observed in plasma when faricimab has been administered as repeat doses in the vitreous.</p>

<h2>14.1	Neovascular (wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD)</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and efficacy of VABYSMO were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, active comparator-controlled, 2-year studies (TENAYA – NCT03823287 and LUCERNE – NCT03823300) in patients with nAMD.</p>
<p>A total of 1,329 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients were enrolled in these studies, and 664 patients received at least one dose of VABYSMO. Patient ages ranged from 50 to 99 with a mean of 75.9 years. The studies were identically designed two year studies. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: 1) aflibercept 2 mg administered fixed every 8 weeks (Q8W) after three initial monthly doses; and VABYSMO 6 mg (0.05 mL of 120 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 ± 7 days, monthly) for the first 4 doses, followed by optical coherence tomography and visual acuity evaluations 8 and 12 weeks later to determine whether to give a 6 mg (0.05 mL of 120 mg/mL solution) dose via intravitreal injection on one of the following three regimens: 1) Weeks 28 and 44; (also referred to as Q16W dosing); 2) Weeks 24, 36 and 48 (also referred to as Q12W dosing); or 3) Weeks 20, 28, 36 and 44 (also referred to as Q8W dosing). However, the utility of these criteria to guide dosing intervals has not been established.</p>
<p>At week 48, after 4 initial monthly doses in the VABYSMO arm, 45% of patients received the  Weeks 28 and 44 dosing, 33% of patients received the Weeks 24, 36 and 48 dosing, and the remaining 22% of patients received dosing every 8 weeks. These percentages are reflective of what happened within the conduct of these trials and indicate that some patients did well on two (2) doses spaced 16 weeks apart, or three (3) doses spaced 12 weeks apart, but the percentages may not be generalizable to a broader nAMD population for a variety of reasons. The inclusion/exclusion criteria limited enrollment to a select subset of treatment naive, newly diagnosed nAMD patients and there is no empirical data that a similar magnitude would be observed if eligibility criteria allowed for broader enrollment. The disease activity criteria, which was instrumental in determining dose frequency, is unvalidated. Stricter criteria would have changed how patients were treated resulting in different percentages of subjects in each dose interval cohort. There was not a similarly dosed aflibercept arm for comparison, which makes the percentages difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>Both studies demonstrated non-inferiority to the comparator control (aflibercept) at the primary endpoint, defined as the mean change from baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) when averaged over the week 40, 44, and 48 visits and measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter chart. The primary endpoint analysis was a non- inferiority comparison for the mean change in BCVA between the aflibercept and the VABYSMO arm.

<h2>14.2	Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)</h2>
<p class="First">The safety and efficacy of VABYSMO were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, active comparator-controlled 2-year studies (YOSEMITE – NCT03622580 and RHINE – NCT03622593) in patients with DME.</p>
<p>A total of 1,891 diabetic patients were enrolled in the two studies with a total of 1,262 patients treated with at least one dose of VABYSMO. Patient ages ranged from 24 to 91 with a mean of 62.2 years. The overall population included both anti-VEGF naive patients (78%) and patients who had been previously treated with a VEGF inhibitor prior to study participation (22%).</p>
<p>The studies were identically designed 2 year studies. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment regimens: 1) aflibercept Q8W, patients received fixed aflibercept 2 mg administered every 8 weeks (Q8W) after the first five monthly doses; 2) VABYSMO Q8W, patients received fixed VABYSMO 6 mg administered Q8W after the first six monthly doses; and 3) VABYSMO Variable, patients received VABYSMO 6 mg administered every 4 weeks for at least 4 doses and until the central subfield thickness (CST) of the macula measured by optical coherence tomography was less than approximately 325 microns, then the interval of dosing was modified by up to 4 week interval extensions or reductions in up to 8 week interval increments based on CST and visual acuity disease activity criteria at study drug dosing visits. However, the utility of these disease activity criteria to guide dosing intervals has not been established.</p>
<p>After 4 initial monthly doses, the patients in the VABYSMO Variable arm could have received between the minimum of three and the maximum of eleven total injections through Week 56 inclusive. At Week 56, 32% of patients had completed at least one Q12W interval followed by one full Q16W interval. Seventeen percent (17%) of patients were treated on Q8W and/or Q4W dosing intervals through Week 56 (7% only on Q4W). Sustainability of the Q16W dosing interval cannot be determined based on year one data alone. These percentages are reflective of what happened within the conduct of these trials, but the percentages are not generalizable to a broader DME population for a variety of reasons. The inclusion/exclusion criteria limited enrollment to a select subset of DME patients and there is no empirical data that a similar magnitude would be observed if eligibility criteria allowed for broader enrollment. The disease activity criteria, which was instrumental in determining dose frequency, is unvalidated. Stricter criteria would have changed how patients were treated resulting in different percentages of subjects in each dose interval cohort. There was not a similarly dosed aflibercept arm for comparison which makes the percentages difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>Both studies demonstrated non-inferiority to the comparator control (aflibercept) at the primary endpoint, defined as the primary endpoint, defined as the mean change from baseline in BCVA at year 1 (average of the week 48, 52, and 56 visits), measured by the ETDRS Letter Score. The primary endpoint analysis was a non-inferiority comparison for the mean change in BCVA between the aflibercept and VABYSMO groups. The lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the mean change in BCVA could not be lower than minus 4 letters to declare non-inferiority. In both studies, VABYSMO Q8W and VABYSMO Variable treated patients had a mean change from baseline in BCVA that was non-inferior to the patients treated with aflibercept Q8W. Detailed results of both studies are shown in <a href="#section-table3">Table 3</a>, <a href="#section-FIGURE_3">Figure 3</a>, and <a href="#section-FIGURE_4">Figure 4</a> below. The clinical efficacy for the second year of the study has not been reviewed.</p>
